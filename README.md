# Eire To-do

A portable, offline Windows desktop to-do widget built with WPF and .NET 10.
The Windows x64 release bundles its runtime in `EireTodo.exe`; users unzip and
double-click it under a standard account. It uses no installer, services,
accounts, elevated privileges, or network requests.

## Interface update 1.1

The interface now uses 17 px body/table text, bright white labels, dark black/slate
panels and yellow focus indicators. Explicit window styling fixes the white
background shown in the first Windows screenshots; explicit dropdown templates
show project and category names. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

To update, close the running app, download and extract the new ZIP, then replace
or run the new `EireTodo.exe`. The app reads the same local data folder and schema;
there is no data migration or separate runtime installation.

## Run and data

Unzip `artifacts/EireTodo-Windows-x64.zip` into a writable folder and double-click
`EireTodo.exe`. Supports Windows 10 22H2 / Windows 11 x64. Application data and
settings live in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\EireTodo\data.json`. Moving the executable does
not move or reset data. The app is unsigned; normal Windows/company policy may
require IT approval. The app does not bypass security controls.

[QUICKSTART.txt](QUICKSTART.txt) contains the short user guide and recovery steps.

## Features

- Draggable header, edge resizing, normal minimise/maximise/close, adjustable
  opacity (65–100%, default 97%), always on top, persisted window geometry and
  column widths, and per-monitor DPI awareness.
- Create, rename, archive/unarchive projects; All projects includes archived
  projects and their tasks. Archived projects cannot receive new tasks.
- Eight-column table, sorting by every header, horizontal/vertical scrolling,
  adjustable widths, short notes previews, and a full multiline notes editor.
- Add, edit, complete/reopen, confirm-delete tasks; optional hiding of completed
  tasks. Description and project required; optional start/finish dates,
  reusable categories, and notes. Created date/time is recorded when saved and
  preserved when edited. Australian dates and 24-hour local times throughout.
- Combined project, task text, notes text/blank, category/blank, status,
  start/finish range/blank, and created date/time range filters. Inclusive bounds,
  optional open bounds, validation and a visible Clear filters button.
- Atomic autosaves with durable temporary-file flush, previous-save recovery,
  single-instance profile lock, validated full-data backup/restore, and a
  pre-restore safety copy. Save failures stay visible and reject the failed edit.

The supplied logo's visible yellow/black mark is rendered as WPF vector geometry,
with the reference image's 500:123 proportions and a transparent remainder. The
original attachment binary was not available as a local file; this is a vector
reproduction of the visible artwork, not an embedded original image file.

## Build on Windows (no administrator privileges)

From the source directory in Windows PowerShell 5.1 or later:

```powershell
.\scripts\build-windows.ps1
```

The script uses SDK **10.0.401** if available, otherwise downloads the official
portable Windows x64 SDK archive to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\EireTodoBuildTools`, verifies
its pinned SHA-512 hash, and extracts it there. It does not use an installer,
change execution policy, or request elevation. Building needs HTTPS access to
`builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` and NuGet endpoints; running the resulting app is
fully offline. If policy prevents scripts or executables from running, follow
your organisation's approval process.

If you already have the pinned SDK, the exact underlying build commands are:

```powershell
dotnet restore tests/EireTodo.Checks/EireTodo.Checks.csproj --locked-mode
dotnet run --project tests/EireTodo.Checks/EireTodo.Checks.csproj -c Release --no-restore
dotnet restore src/EireTodo.Windows/EireTodo.Windows.csproj --locked-mode
dotnet publish src/EireTodo.Windows/EireTodo.Windows.csproj -c Release --no-restore -o artifacts/windows-x64
```

The project pins `win-x64`, `SelfContained=true`, `PublishSingleFile=true`,
`IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true` and disables trimming. The published
app needs only `EireTodo.exe`. Its embedded manifest requests `asInvoker`, with
`uiAccess=false` and `PerMonitorV2` DPI awareness. The runtime extracts native
libraries to the current user's temporary cache; no machine-wide files are
installed. Developers need an SDK; people running the portable app do not.

## Build/check in this Linux cloud environment

```bash
bash scripts/setup-cloud.sh
```

This uses a checksum-verified portable Linux SDK in `/workspace/.tools/dotnet`,
restores locked dependencies, runs functional checks, and cross-publishes the
Windows executable. Existing checkouts are used; each cloud task is isolated,
so no additional Git worktree is needed. The Linux setup script's paths assume
the onboarding checkout `/workspace/Eire-To-do-list`.

The Windows SDK bootstrap/PowerShell script is supplied for Windows, but was
not executed here. The equivalent Linux restore/test/publish commands were
executed successfully. Linux cannot run WPF, so native window controls,
interactive desktop operations, mixed-DPI displays, security policy behaviour
and real Windows account launch remain unverified.

## Source and verification

- `src/EireTodo.Core`: models, validation, combined filtering, atomic JSON
  storage, backup/restore and transactional operations.
- `src/EireTodo.Windows`: WPF UI, Windows manifest, window settings and profile
  data location.
- `tests/EireTodo.Checks`: dependency-free executable functional checks,
  including disk failures and corruption recovery. A failing check exits nonzero.
- [VERIFICATION.md](VERIFICATION.md): actual build/check evidence and limits.
- [WINDOWS-VERIFICATION.md](WINDOWS-VERIFICATION.md): exact remaining desktop
  acceptance steps to run under a standard Windows account.

Data is plain JSON with schema version 1. Internal JSON dates use ISO serialization;
only display/input uses Australian formatting. Created timestamps retain their
offset and display in the computer's current local timezone. Exported backups
contain notes and other personal data; store them where you intend.
